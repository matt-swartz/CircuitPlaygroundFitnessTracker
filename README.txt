How does it work:
The device is put on the left or right bicep, turned on and 4 NeoPixels light up red to show that none of our 4 exercises are done. When the right button is pressed all 10 NeoPixels turn red to show us the sit-ups and squats are not done. When a sit-up is done the right side lights one light to green and the speaker makes a noise telling us a rep is done. Same with the left side and the 5 squat reps. When you press the left button again 10 lights light up red and the right side is for push-ups and the left jumping jacks. Again when a rep is complete the speaker rings and one light turns green. Clicking the right button again takes you back to the squats and sit-ups screen storing the reps. A double press of either button will take you back to the 4 NeoPixel main screen that lights up green when the 5 reps of one exercise is done. The switch will be used to reset the device if need be. Accelerometer tracks each exercise and values can be seen in the code. We register each of the three movements of each exercise the down up and back down or whatever it is. 

How well does it work: 
The device works very well for recording each of the exercises, especially the push-ups and jumping jacks. Where the sit-ups can be messed up is going from standing up to the ground with the right button pressed. Pressing the left button going to the ground and then pressing the right button can help. The squats can also be tricked with random arm movements. 

Improvements for the Future:
The way the squats could be fixed if I had more time was some type of data structure with all the squat values. Some way to delay the accelerometer from going to standing up to the ground.Besides this nothing is really bad besides maybe cleaning up the code to make it even smaller in size.
